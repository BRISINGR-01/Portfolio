Even though my experience is limited to deploying monolith projects I have explored and written research concerning various system designs such as microservices, event-driven, and other more scalabe architectures. I have worked with various deployment platforms such as Vercel, Firebase and Heroku. My expertise extends beyond simple websites, encompassing the development of browser extensions, basic cybersecurity obtained through experiences like Hack The Box challenges, and the creation of immersive 3D experiences.",

This is a solar panel industry. We are proud to share that our team has made it to the finals of the SDG Challenge 2025, where we partnered with Solarwatt on a project called SolarTrace. SolarTrace is a platform that helps bring more transparency to the solar energy industry. It includes an interactive map that shows how solar panel materials move through Europe and Asia, giving users a clearer view of the supply chain. My main focus was on the course and certification module. I built a simple learning path that introduces Solarwatt, its mission, and products, and at the end, users get a professional, shareable certificate automatically..",

Each challenge pushed me to learn something new or dig deeper into old tools in unexpected ways. I especially enjoyed the variety and how it forced me to stay flexible — jumping from Gobuster scans to decoding a payload from an embedded PowerShell script felt like a proper mental workout."
