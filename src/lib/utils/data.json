Even though my experience is limited to deploying monolith projects I have explored and written research concerning various system designs such as microservices, event-driven, and other more scalabe architectures. I have worked with various deployment platforms such as Vercel, Firebase and Heroku. My expertise extends beyond simple websites, encompassing the development of browser extensions, basic cybersecurity obtained through experiences like Hack The Box challenges, and the creation of immersive 3D experiences.",
