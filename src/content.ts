SolarTrace is a platform that helps bring more transparency to the solar energy industry. It includes an interactive map that shows how solar panel materials move through Europe and Asia, giving users a clearer view of the supply chain. My main focus was on the course and certification module. I built a simple learning path that introduces Solarwatt, its mission, and products, and at the end, users get a professional, shareable certificate automatically...",

Throughout, Stroustrup presents concise, “pure C++11” examples, which have been carefully crafted to clarify both usage and program design. To promote deeper understanding, the author provides extensive cross-references, both within the book and to the ISO standard.",

		"Design Patterns":
			"Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves.",
		Code: "Dives into the fundamental concepts of computer science, starting from basic electrical circuits to the intricate workings of modern computers. The book explores how simple ideas and technologies evolve into complex systems, making the world of computing accessible and engaging for both technical and non-technical readers.",

			"The guide to how to transform code with safe and rapid process, vital to keeping it cheap and easy to modify for future needs.",
